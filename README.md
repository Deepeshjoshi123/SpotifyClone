Spotify Clone - HTML & CSS

Welcome to my Spotify clone project! This project aims to replicate the user interface of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify, using HTML and CSS. 

Features:

- UI Replication: The project focuses on mimicking Spotify's interface, including the layout, color scheme, and design elements.
- Static Content: While the project does not include functional features like music playback or user authentication, it provides a static representation of Spotify's main components.
- HTML & CSS: Developed purely with HTML and CSS, this project showcases the power of front-end technologies in creating visually appealing web applications.
- Non-Responsive Design:** Please note that the project is not responsive and may not display optimally across all devices. It is recommended to view it on desktop browsers for the best experience.

How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to explore the Spotify clone interface.
